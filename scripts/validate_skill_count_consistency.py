"""Validate that every doc-cited skill count matches the on-disk count.

Prevents the class of drift where a PR adds a skill but forgets to bump
counts in README.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / hero-banner.svg / skills/README.md /
FRAMEWORK_COVERAGE.md / CHANGELOG.md. Run in CI next to the other
`validate_*.py` scripts.

Passes silently; fails with a diff-style report pointing to each claim that
does not equal the true count from `find skills -name SKILL.md`.

The check is **anchored to explicit patterns** (e.g. `N shipped skill bundles`,
`Total: N shipped skills`, `N shipped detectors`). A bare number like `82`
elsewhere in docs is ignored — we only assert the patterns we own.
