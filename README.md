Security skills for cloud and AI systems. Use source-specific ingest, discovery, detection, evaluation, view, and remediation skills from the CLI, CI, MCP, or persistent runners without changing the skill code.

- OCSF is supported, not mandatory.
- Read-only by default; write paths stay HITL and audited.
- Trust, schema, and runtime behavior are documented and validated in CI.

## Start Here

| If you need to... | Start with... | Typical output |
|---|---|---|
| Normalize one raw source | `ingest-*` | repo-native JSONL or OCSF JSONL |
| Detect suspicious behavior | `ingest-*` + `detect-*` | repo-native finding JSON or OCSF Detection Finding |
| Benchmark posture | `evaluation/*` | benchmark or control results |
| Inventory cloud or AI assets | `discover-environment` or `discover-ai-bom` | graph JSON, AI BOM, OCSF bridge |
| Build evidence for audits | `discover-control-evidence` or `discover-cloud-control-evidence` | evidence JSON |
| Export findings | `view/*` | SARIF or Mermaid attack flow |
| Remediate offboarding safely | `iam-departures-remediation` | dry-run plan or audited action log |

For the full source, asset, framework, and runtime crosswalk, see [docs/USE_CASES.md](docs/USE_CASES.md).

## Quick Run

Start with the bundled Kubernetes audit fixture and generate SARIF in one shot:

```bash
python skills/ingestion/ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf/src/ingest.py \
  skills/detection-engineering/golden/k8s_audit_raw_sample.jsonl \
  | python skills/detection/detect-privilege-escalation-k8s/src/detect.py \
  | python skills/view/convert-ocsf-to-sarif/src/convert.py \
  > findings.sarif
```

If you want to inspect each stage separately, use throwaway files under `/tmp`:

```bash
python skills/ingestion/ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf/src/ingest.py \
  skills/detection-engineering/golden/k8s_audit_raw_sample.jsonl \
  > /tmp/k8s-events.jsonl

python skills/detection/detect-privilege-escalation-k8s/src/detect.py \
  /tmp/k8s-events.jsonl \
  > /tmp/k8s-findings.jsonl

python skills/view/convert-ocsf-to-sarif/src/convert.py \
  /tmp/k8s-findings.jsonl \
  > findings.sarif
```

`/tmp` here just means scratch files for debugging. The final output you keep is `findings.sarif`.

If you want the repo-owned native wire format instead of OCSF:

```bash
python skills/ingestion/ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf/src/ingest.py \
  --output-format native \
  skills/detection-engineering/golden/k8s_audit_raw_sample.jsonl \
  | python skills/detection/detect-privilege-escalation-k8s/src/detect.py \
      --output-format native \
  > findings.native.jsonl
```

## Native vs OCSF

| Mode | What it means | Use it when... |
|---|---|---|
| `native` | repo-owned external wire format in JSONL, with fields like `schema_mode`, `canonical_schema_version`, `record_type`, and stable UIDs | you want the repo's stable schema without an interoperability envelope |
| `ocsf` | OCSF JSONL pinned to the repo's OCSF contract | you want a standard external schema for SIEMs, exports, or downstream tooling |
| `canonical` | internal-only normalization model | you are reading the docs or implementation, not choosing a CLI output mode |
| `bridge` | interoperable output with native context preserved | you need both standard fields and repo context in one payload |

`native` is not raw vendor JSON and not an OCSF envelope with fields stripped out.
`native` = repo-owned external wire format. See [docs/NATIVE_VS_OCSF.md](docs/NATIVE_VS_OCSF.md) and [docs/CANONICAL_SCHEMA.md](docs/CANONICAL_SCHEMA.md).

## Flagship Example

The flagship example skill family is IAM departures remediation: a guarded, event-driven workflow with a dual audit trail and clear trust boundaries.

![IAM departures cross-cloud workflow](docs/images/iam-departures-architecture.svg)

## Trust, Security, And Supply Chain

- Read-only by default; write paths require human approval and audit.
- No hardcoded secrets; prefer workload identity and short-lived credentials.
- Official vendor SDKs first, repo-owned code second, canonical OSS only when needed.
- CI validates skill contracts, integrity, safe-skill bar, coverage, type checking, and SBOM generation.

## Core Surfaces

| Surface | Best fit |
|---|---|
| CLI / Unix pipes | local triage, fixture testing, repeatable one-shot pipelines |
| MCP | Claude, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cortex Code CLI |
| CI | scheduled checks, PR gates, SARIF generation, benchmark snapshots |
| Persistent runner | event-driven or batch execution around the same stateless skills |
| SIEM / lakehouse | normalized findings, evidence, or customer-owned audit sinks |

## Shipped Vs Planned

| Topic | Shipped today | Planned / supported pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime surfaces | CLI, CI, MCP, `runners/aws-s3-sqs-detect`, IAM departures workflow | more multi-cloud runner templates |
| Audit sinks | IAM departures dual-write to DynamoDB + S3 | customer sinks like Snowflake, Security Lake, ClickHouse, BigQuery |
| Schema modes | native, canonical, OCSF, bridge contract; ingest and detect are fully dual-mode | extend dual-mode patterns to more families where appropriate |
| Remediation | IAM departures with HITL and audit | broader remediation families |

<summary><b>Schema Modes</b></summary>

The repo contract supports `native`, `canonical`, `ocsf`, and `bridge`.

- `canonical`: internal repo-owned normalization layer
- `native`: repo-owned external wire format
- `ocsf`: interoperable external wire format
- `bridge`: native context preserved alongside interoperable fields

`-ocsf` in a skill name means OCSF is the default wire format, not necessarily the only supported output.

<summary><b>Layers And Runtime Model</b></summary>

| Layer | Use it for | Start with |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest | raw source to stable event stream | source-specific `ingest-*` |
| Discover | inventory, graph context, evidence | `discover-*` |
| Detect | deterministic attack-pattern findings | `detect-*` |
| Evaluate | benchmark and posture checks | `evaluation/*` |
| View | export into downstream formats | `view/*` |
| Remediate | guarded write path with HITL and audit | `iam-departures-remediation` |

The skill contract stays the same across runtime surfaces: `SKILL.md + src/ + tests/` is the product; CLI, CI, MCP, and runners are only access paths.
