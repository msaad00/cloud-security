Security skills for cloud and AI systems. Use source-specific ingest, discovery, detection, evaluation, view, and remediation skills from the CLI, CI, MCP, or persistent runners without changing the skill code.

- OCSF 1.8 is the default interoperable wire format for event and finding streams.
- Native is the repo-owned operational format for evaluation, discovery, sinks, remediation, and domains where OCSF would be lossy.
- Read-only by default; write paths stay HITL and audited.
- Trust, schema, and runtime behavior are documented and validated in CI.

## Start Here

| If you need to... | Start with... | Typical output |
|---|---|---|
| Normalize one raw source | `ingest-*` | repo-native JSONL or OCSF JSONL |
| Detect suspicious behavior | `ingest-*` + `detect-*` | repo-native finding JSON or OCSF Detection Finding |
| Benchmark posture | `evaluation/*` | benchmark or control results |
| Inventory cloud or AI assets | `discover-environment` or `discover-ai-bom` | graph JSON, AI BOM, OCSF bridge |
| Build evidence for audits | `discover-control-evidence` or `discover-cloud-control-evidence` | evidence JSON |
| Export findings | `view/*` | SARIF or Mermaid attack flow |
| Remediate offboarding safely | `iam-departures-remediation` | dry-run plan or audited action log |

For the full source, asset, framework, and runtime crosswalk, see [docs/USE_CASES.md](docs/USE_CASES.md).

## Install And Trust Model

This repo is not primarily distributed as a single PyPI-installed application.

The intended trust and execution model is:

- clone the repo at a tagged release
- verify the signed tag and release-attached signed SBOM set
- install only the dependency groups you actually need from `pyproject.toml`
- run the skill bundles directly, through MCP, in CI, or behind the shipped runners

In other words:

- `uv.lock` is the full dependency ceiling
- real operator installs are narrower and runtime-specific
- the trust boundary is the repo release itself, not an opaque package wrapper

See:

- [docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md](docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md)
- [docs/CREDENTIAL_PROVENANCE.md](docs/CREDENTIAL_PROVENANCE.md)
- [docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)

## Quick Run

Each shipped skill is a bundle:

- `SKILL.md` for routing, guardrails, and approval model
- `REFERENCES.md` for the official source-of-truth docs
- `src/` for the executable implementation
- `tests/` for contract and regression coverage

The Python file is the execution core. The full skill that agents use is the
whole bundle.

Why the README shows `python skills/.../src/<entry>.py`:

- that is the direct execution path for the skill implementation
- MCP, CI, and runners call the same skill code
- agent clients add the `SKILL.md` contract, routing hints, and guardrails on top
- the wrapper changes the access path, not the underlying skill implementation

Start with the bundled Kubernetes audit fixture and generate SARIF in one shot:

```bash
python skills/ingestion/ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf/src/ingest.py \
  skills/detection-engineering/golden/k8s_audit_raw_sample.jsonl \
  | python skills/detection/detect-privilege-escalation-k8s/src/detect.py \
  | python skills/view/convert-ocsf-to-sarif/src/convert.py \
  > findings.sarif
```

If you want to inspect each stage separately, write local scratch files in the
current directory:

```bash
python skills/ingestion/ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf/src/ingest.py \
  skills/detection-engineering/golden/k8s_audit_raw_sample.jsonl \
  > k8s-events.ocsf.jsonl

python skills/detection/detect-privilege-escalation-k8s/src/detect.py \
  k8s-events.ocsf.jsonl \
  > k8s-findings.ocsf.jsonl

python skills/view/convert-ocsf-to-sarif/src/convert.py \
  k8s-findings.ocsf.jsonl \
  > findings.sarif
```

Those intermediate files are only for debugging. The final output you usually
keep is `findings.sarif`.

If you want the repo-owned native wire format instead of OCSF:

```bash
python skills/ingestion/ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf/src/ingest.py \
  --output-format native \
  skills/detection-engineering/golden/k8s_audit_raw_sample.jsonl \
  | python skills/detection/detect-privilege-escalation-k8s/src/detect.py \
      --output-format native \
  > findings.native.jsonl
```

### Real input and output

Input fixture line, abbreviated:

```json
{"kind":"Event","stage":"ResponseComplete","verb":"list","auditID":"k1-list-secrets","user":{"username":"system:serviceaccount:default:builder"}}
```

OCSF event output, abbreviated:

```json
{"class_uid":6003,"class_name":"API Activity","metadata":{"uid":"k1-list-secrets"},"api":{"operation":"list"},"resources":[{"type":"secrets","namespace":"default"}]}
```

Native event output, abbreviated:

```json
{"schema_mode":"native","record_type":"api_activity","event_uid":"k1-list-secrets","operation":"list","resources":[{"type":"secrets","namespace":"default"}]}
```

OCSF finding output, abbreviated:

```json
{"class_uid":2004,"class_name":"Detection Finding","finding_info":{"title":"Service account enumerated and read a Kubernetes secret"}}
```

Native finding output, abbreviated:

```json
{"schema_mode":"native","record_type":"detection_finding","title":"Service account enumerated and read a Kubernetes secret"}
```

### Same skill, different access path

The skill code stays the same across all of these:

- direct CLI:
  - `python skills/ingestion/ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf/src/ingest.py ...`
- MCP / agent:
  - Claude, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, or Cortex call the same skill through
    `mcp-server/`
- CI:
  - GitHub Actions or another pipeline invokes the same script and checks its output
- runner:
  - the runner template wraps the same skill in an event-driven path

Agent clients do not require a second implementation of the skill. They use the
same skill bundle through a different access path.

## Native vs OCSF

| Mode | What it means | Use it when... |
|---|---|---|
| `native` | repo-owned external wire format in JSONL, with fields like `schema_mode`, `canonical_schema_version`, `record_type`, and stable UIDs | you want the repo's stable schema without an interoperability envelope |
| `ocsf` | OCSF JSONL pinned to the repo's OCSF contract | you want a standard external schema for SIEMs, exports, or downstream tooling |
| `canonical` | internal-only normalization model | you are reading the docs or implementation, not choosing a CLI output mode |
| `bridge` | interoperable output with native context preserved | you need both standard fields and repo context in one payload |

`native` is not raw vendor JSON and not an OCSF envelope with fields stripped out.
`native` = repo-owned external wire format. See [docs/NATIVE_VS_OCSF.md](docs/NATIVE_VS_OCSF.md) and [docs/CANONICAL_SCHEMA.md](docs/CANONICAL_SCHEMA.md).

## Flagship Example

The flagship example skill family is IAM departures remediation: a guarded, event-driven workflow with a dual audit trail and clear trust boundaries.

## Trust, Security, And Supply Chain

- Read-only by default; write paths require human approval and audit.
- No hardcoded secrets; prefer workload identity and short-lived credentials.
- Official vendor SDKs first, repo-owned code second, canonical OSS only when needed.
- CI validates skill contracts, integrity, safe-skill bar, coverage, type checking, and SBOM generation.

## Core Surfaces

| Surface | Best fit |
|---|---|
| CLI / Unix pipes | local triage, fixture testing, repeatable one-shot pipelines |
| MCP | Claude, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cortex Code CLI |
| CI | scheduled checks, PR gates, SARIF generation, benchmark snapshots |
| Persistent runner | event-driven or batch execution around the same stateless skills |
| SIEM / lakehouse | normalized findings, evidence, or customer-owned audit sinks |

## Shipped Vs Planned

| Topic | Shipped today | Planned / supported pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime surfaces | CLI, CI, MCP, AWS/GCP/Azure reference runners, IAM departures workflow | more specialized runners and dialect-specific wrappers where demand justifies them |
| Persistence edges | `sink-snowflake-jsonl`, `sink-clickhouse-jsonl`, `sink-s3-jsonl`, plus IAM departures dual-write to DynamoDB + S3 | additional customer-controlled destinations like Security Lake and BigQuery |
| Query packs | `packs/lateral-movement/` and `packs/privilege-escalation-k8s/` | broader warehouse and dialect coverage |
| Schema modes | native, canonical, OCSF, and bridge are all shipped; ingest and detect are fully dual-mode, while discovery uses native/bridge and evaluation, sinks, and remediation stay native-first | extend OCSF or bridge only where it materially improves interoperability without losing operational clarity |
| Remediation | IAM departures with HITL and audit | broader remediation families |

<summary><b>Schema Modes</b></summary>

The repo contract supports `native`, `canonical`, `ocsf`, and `bridge`.

- `canonical`: internal repo-owned normalization layer
- `native`: repo-owned external wire format
- `ocsf`: interoperable external wire format
- `bridge`: native context preserved alongside interoperable fields

`-ocsf` in a skill name means OCSF is the default wire format, not necessarily the only supported output.

<summary><b>Layers And Runtime Model</b></summary>

| Layer | Use it for | Start with |
|---|---|---|
| Ingest | raw source to stable event stream | source-specific `ingest-*` |
| Discover | inventory, graph context, evidence | `discover-*` |
| Detect | deterministic attack-pattern findings | `detect-*` |
| Evaluate | benchmark and posture checks | `evaluation/*` |
| View | export into downstream formats | `view/*` |
| Remediate | guarded write path with HITL and audit | `iam-departures-remediation` |

The skill contract stays the same across runtime surfaces: `SKILL.md + src/ + tests/` is the product; CLI, CI, MCP, and runners are only access paths.
