**OCSF-native security skills for cloud and AI systems.** Normalise every source to **OCSF 1.8** on the wire, then compose ingest → discover → detect → evaluate → view → remediate flows like Unix pipes. Built for direct CLI use, CI, serverless pipelines, and a thin local MCP wrapper. Read-only by default, least-privilege, zero-trust, closed-loop.

The repo is intentionally broader than CSPM: cloud security, container security, AI infra security, detection engineering, compliance evaluation, and future inventory/enrichment skills such as AI BOM generation all fit here as long as they stay deterministic, auditable, and grounded in official specs.

For coding agents, start with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). For Claude-specific project memory, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). For Claude/Codex/Cortex MCP usage, see [docs/agent-integrations.md](docs/agent-integrations.md) and the project-scoped [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json).

```bash
python skills/ingestion/ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf/src/ingest.py audit.log \
  | python skills/detection/detect-privilege-escalation-k8s/src/detect.py \
  | python skills/view/convert-ocsf-to-sarif/src/convert.py \
  > findings.sarif
```

## Layers

| Layer | Role | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Ingest** | Per-source raw log → OCSF | API / Network / HTTP / Application Activity |
| **Discover** | point-in-time inventory / graph / AI BOM | deterministic JSON graph or CycloneDX-aligned BOM |
| **Detect** | OCSF → finding + MITRE ATT&CK | Detection Finding (class 2004) |
| **Evaluate** | OCSF → framework check | Compliance Finding (class 2003) — CIS / NIST / SOC 2 |
| **View** | OCSF → SARIF / Mermaid / graph | GitHub Security tab, PR comments, dashboards |
| **Remediate** | Finding → action (HITL-gated, audited) | Dual-write audit row |

Each skill is a standalone Python bundle following [Anthropic's skill spec](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide) — `SKILL.md` with trigger phrases and a `Do NOT use…` clause, `src/`, `tests/`, golden fixtures, `REFERENCES.md`. Runs from the CLI, in CI, or via any agent that reads `SKILL.md` (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Codex, Cortex, Windsurf).

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full layered design and [`docs/DIAGRAMS.md`](docs/DIAGRAMS.md) for the visual set.

## How it runs

| Mode | Driver | Best for | Human approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CLI / just-in-time** | Operator or agent runs a skill directly | triage, local analysis, one-off conversions, golden-fixture checks | only for write-capable skills |
| **CI** | GitHub Actions or another pipeline | regression testing, policy checks, compliance snapshots, SARIF generation | never for read-only skills |
| **Persistent / serverless** | runner, queue, EventBridge, Step Functions, scheduled jobs | continuous detection, remediation pipelines, lake ingestion | required for destructive actions |
| **MCP** | local `mcp-server/` wrapper | Claude, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cortex Code CLI | inherited from the wrapped skill |

The important rule is that the **skill code does not change between modes**. `SKILL.md + src/ + tests/` stays the product; the runner, pipeline, or MCP wrapper is only the access path.

## Safety model

| Skill type | Default posture | Required controls |
|---|---|---|
| **Ingest / detect / evaluate / view** | read-only | deterministic output, no hidden writes, official references only |
| **Discovery / inventory / enrich** | read-only unless explicitly documented otherwise | schema validation, output contracts, no secret leakage |
| **Remediation** | dry-run first | least privilege, blast-radius docs, audit trail, HITL gate |
| **Sinks / runners** | side-effectful edge components | idempotency, merge-on-UID, transport security, checkpointing |

For every shipped skill, the contract is:
- exact input and output format
- explicit `Use when...` and `Do NOT use...`
- official vendor docs only in `REFERENCES.md`
- failure-safe behavior on malformed input and deprecated API shapes
- no generic shell, SQL, or network passthrough

## Agent docs

| File | Scope | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| [`README.md`](README.md) | public repo overview | what the repo is, how it is positioned, where to start |
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | cross-agent repo contract | Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cortex, Claude, generic AGENTS.md-aware tools |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Claude Code project memory | repo-wide Claude defaults and working rules |
| `skills/<layer>/<skill>/SKILL.md` | individual skill contract | when to use a skill, input/output, blast radius, non-goals |
| `skills/<layer>/<skill>/REFERENCES.md` | source-of-truth references | official docs, schemas, APIs, benchmarks |

**Roadmap:** current open issues focus on AWS Config and deeper evaluation coverage, richer MCP input schemas and transports, additional cloud and AI service coverage, vendor stories, and deeper discovery / inventory follow-ons beyond the first AI BOM and evidence capabilities.

## Security & trust

This is a security tool. Trustworthiness is the first feature, not an afterthought. Eleven principles pinned in [`SECURITY_BAR.md`](SECURITY_BAR.md), every skill graded against every principle.

<details>
<summary><b>The eleven principles</b></summary>

| # | Principle | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Read-only by default** | Posture + detection NEVER call write APIs. Remediation isolates the write path behind explicit IAM grants and dry-run defaults. |
| 2 | **Agentless** | No daemons, no sidecars, no continuously running processes. Short-lived Python scripts that read what's already there. |
| 3 | **Least privilege** | Each skill documents the EXACT IAM / RBAC permissions it needs in `REFERENCES.md`. Minimal set only. |
| 4 | **Defense in depth** | Posture + detection + remediation + audit + re-verify all run in parallel and back each other up. |
| 5 | **Closed loop** | Every workflow has a verification step: detect → finding → action → audit → re-verify. Drift is itself a detection. |
| 6 | **OCSF on the wire** | All ingest + detect skills speak OCSF 1.8 JSONL. MITRE ATT&CK lives inside `finding_info.attacks[]`. |
| 7 | **Secure by design** | Security is a first-class input to the skill's architecture, not a bolt-on. |
| 8 | **Secure code** | Defensive parsing on every input boundary. No `eval`/`exec`/`pickle.loads` on untrusted data. Parameterised SQL only. `bandit` in CI. |
| 9 | **Secure secrets & tokens** | No hardcoded creds. Secrets from cloud secret stores. Short-lived tokens. Logs scrub creds. CI greps for `AKIA` / `sk-` / `ghp_` patterns. |
| 10 | **No telemetry** | No phone-home. Findings stay local unless the operator explicitly forwards them. |
| 11 | **HITL, no rogue behaviour** | A skill never escalates its own privileges, never bypasses guardrails, never invokes siblings it wasn't composed with. Destructive actions require HITL gates. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How trust is verified</b></summary>

| Check | What it catches | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Golden-fixture deep-eq** | Silent detection-coverage regressions after a refactor | Per-skill `pytest` — `tests/test_*.py::TestGoldenFixture` |
| **Wire-contract tests** | Off-spec events, wrong `class_uid`, missing required fields, `attacks[]` at the wrong level | Cross-skill assertions pinned in [`OCSF_CONTRACT.md`](skills/detection-engineering/OCSF_CONTRACT.md) |
| **End-to-end pipes** | Breakage across the `ingest → detect → convert` chain | `tests/integration/` — deep-eq against frozen SARIF + Mermaid |
| **Static analysis** | Unsafe parsing, missing imports, style drift | `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` + `bandit` on every PR |
| **Hardcoded-secret grep** | Leaked `AKIA…` / `sk-…` / `ghp_…` tokens before they ship | CI lint job, repo-wide on every push |
| **`REFERENCES.md` per skill** | Fabricated APIs, opaque dependencies, undocumented IAM | Presence enforced by CI; manual review on new skills |
| **Skill integrity validator** | Name drift, MCP metadata drift, unapproved reference domains, dangerous runtime patterns | `scripts/validate_skill_integrity.py` in CI and integration tests |
| **`agent-bom` scans** | Vulnerable deps, IaC misconfig, shadow AI components | `code` / `skills scan` / `fs` / `iac` on every push; findings land in GitHub Security tab under `agent-bom-iac` |

## Contributing

New skills land as standalone bundles. The checklist:

1. **Pick a layer** — ingest, discover, enrich, detect, evaluate, remediate, or convert
2. **Copy the nearest sibling** — the existing skills in the target category are the canonical reference layout
3. **Ship the bundle** — `SKILL.md` with a `Do NOT use…` clause, `src/<entry>.py`, `tests/test_<entry>.py`, golden fixtures under `skills/detection-engineering/golden/` when the skill speaks OCSF, and `REFERENCES.md` listing every official doc the skill depends on
4. **Add a row** to the [`SECURITY_BAR.md`](SECURITY_BAR.md) matrix
5. **Wire into CI** — add the skill to the right matrix cell in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
6. **Open a PR** — [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) is the review contract; make sure your skill satisfies every applicable guardrail
