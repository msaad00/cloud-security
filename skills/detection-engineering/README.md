# detection-engineering/

Detection rules, threat hunts, and runtime monitors for AI infrastructure and traditional cloud surfaces. This category answers the question:

> *What does an attack look like on this surface, and how do I see it the next time it happens?*

## Design principles

### 1. OCSF is the wire format between skills

Every skill in this category reads and writes **OCSF 1.3+ JSONL** ([Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework](https://schema.ocsf.io/)). Skills do **not** import from each other — they compose via stdin/stdout pipes like Unix tools:

```bash
cat cloudtrail.json                                              \
  | python -m ingest_cloudtrail_ocsf                             \
  | python -m detect_credential_access_ocsf                      \
  | python -m ocsf_to_sarif > findings.sarif
```

This keeps every skill self-contained (per the Anthropic skills spec, which requires each skill to be a standalone bundle), and the OCSF contract is the only cross-skill dependency.

### 2. Three skill shapes

| Shape | Prefix | Input | Output | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ingest** | `ingest-` | raw log (JSONL / JSON / NDJSON) from one source | OCSF event of the right class | `ingest-mcp-proxy-ocsf` |
| **detect** | `detect-` | OCSF events (any class) | **OCSF Security Finding** (class 2001) | `detect-mcp-tool-drift` |
| **convert** | under `convert/` | OCSF Security Finding | format for downstream tool | `convert/ocsf-to-sarif` |

A new log source = a new `ingest-*` skill. A new attack pattern = a new `detect-*` skill. A new downstream tool = a new `convert/*` skill. None of them need to know about the others beyond the OCSF contract.

### 3. MITRE ATT&CK lives inside OCSF, not alongside it

OCSF Security Finding has a first-class `attacks[]` field. Every detection must populate it with the appropriate tactic / technique / sub-technique. That's the pivot point for analytics later — you don't need a parallel MITRE mapping table because the mapping *is* the finding.

```json
{
  "class_uid": 2001,
  "attacks": [{
    "version": "v14",
    "tactic": {"name": "Initial Access", "uid": "TA0001"},
    "technique": {"name": "Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain", "uid": "T1195.001"}
  }]
}
```

### 4. Golden fixtures, not mocks

Every detection skill tests against a **frozen OCSF fixture** in [`golden/`](golden/). When you add a new detection, the first thing you add is the input fixture (what the attack looks like on the wire) and the expected OCSF Security Finding output. The test becomes a contract: *"given these events, this rule MUST produce this finding."* That's what makes detections refactorable without silent regressions.

### 5. Closed loop, same as every other category

Detection engineering closes the loop by being *checkable*: a finding is either present on the next run over the same fixture, or it isn't. If a refactor loses coverage, the golden test fails. If an attacker tweaks their technique, you add a new fixture and a new test; the old one stays green so you know you didn't lose old coverage.

## Current skills

| Skill | Shape | Surface | MITRE | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`ingest-mcp-proxy-ocsf`](ingest-mcp-proxy-ocsf/) | ingest | agent-bom MCP proxy JSONL | n/a (ingest-only) | ✅ first citizen |
| [`detect-mcp-tool-drift`](detect-mcp-tool-drift/) | detect | MCP tool schemas | `T1195.001` Supply Chain Compromise | ✅ first citizen |

## Roadmap

The category is intentionally opinionated about what comes next. Every row below is a single skill with a single OCSF class as input and OCSF Security Finding as output.

### Ingestion (`ingest-*`)

| Skill | Source | OCSF class produced |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest-cloudtrail-ocsf` | AWS CloudTrail | API Activity (6003) |

| `ingest-azure-activity-ocsf` | Azure Activity Logs | API Activity (6003) |
| `ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf` | Kubernetes audit logs | API Activity (6003) |

### Conversion (`convert/*`)

| Skill | From | To |
|---|---|---|
| `convert/ocsf-to-sarif` | OCSF Security Finding | SARIF 2.1.0 (GitHub code scanning) |
| `convert/ocsf-to-sigma` | OCSF Security Finding | Sigma rule (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel) |
| `convert/ocsf-to-mermaid` | OCSF Security Finding | Mermaid attack-flow diagram for PR comments |

## Analytics and visualization

Detections produce OCSF. Everything downstream consumes OCSF. See [`analytics/README.md`](analytics/README.md) for the target stack (ClickHouse + Grafana) and the OCSF-to-ClickHouse schema mapping.
