# Changelog

All notable changes to `cloud-ai-security-skills` should be recorded here.

This changelog is intentionally **repo-level**, not per-skill semver. The repo
is released as one trust boundary: one CI bar, one MCP wrapper, one validation
model, one security posture. Individual skills track maturity and contract
metadata inside their own docs.

The format is loosely based on Keep a Changelog.

## Unreleased

### Added

- [`scripts/benchmark_runtime_profiles.py`](scripts/benchmark_runtime_profiles.py) plus a checked-in runtime snapshot at [`docs/benchmarks/runtime-profiles-2026-04-16.json`](docs/benchmarks/runtime-profiles-2026-04-16.json) so the representative sizing tables in [`docs/RUNTIME_PROFILES.md`](docs/RUNTIME_PROFILES.md) can be regenerated from code instead of drifting as prose.
- a `Runtime Benchmarks` workflow plus [`scripts/check_runtime_profile_regressions.py`](scripts/check_runtime_profile_regressions.py) so the benchmark harness can run on demand or nightly and compare scaling behavior against the checked-in baseline instead of relying on timestamp-sensitive JSON diffs.

### Changed

- optimized `detect-lateral-movement` to index candidate flows instead of repeatedly rescanning the full flow set per anchor, and added a duplicate-heavy regression test so the faster path preserves the same findings while keeping the benchmarked 10x case in line with the documented runtime envelope.

### Planned for v0.5.1

- add parser-hardening follow-up tests on the highest-volume ingestion paths so malformed mixed-shape input keeps failing closed without breaking valid records in the same batch
- improve visual accessibility and readability with diagram descriptions, clearer captions, and continued overlap cleanup in rendered SVGs
- continue post-release quality work such as mutation/property-based parser testing where it adds measurable confidence without changing shipped contracts

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-15

### Added

- [`docs/NATIVE_VS_OCSF.md`](docs/NATIVE_VS_OCSF.md) and [`docs/STATE_AND_TIMELINE_MODEL.md`](docs/STATE_AND_TIMELINE_MODEL.md) to make `native`, `canonical`, `ocsf`, and `bridge` modes explicit and to pin historical-state, tombstone, and timeline expectations across just-in-time and persistent runs.
- [`docs/DEBUGGING.md`](docs/DEBUGGING.md) and [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for operator-facing format, CI, and runtime troubleshooting.
- [`docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md), [`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md), [`docs/DATA_HANDLING.md`](docs/DATA_HANDLING.md), [`docs/COMPLIANCE_MAPPINGS.md`](docs/COMPLIANCE_MAPPINGS.md), [`docs/SCHEMA_VERSIONING.md`](docs/SCHEMA_VERSIONING.md), [`docs/LOSSY_MAPPINGS.md`](docs/LOSSY_MAPPINGS.md), [`docs/ERROR_CODES.md`](docs/ERROR_CODES.md), [`docs/STDERR_TELEMETRY_CONTRACT.md`](docs/STDERR_TELEMETRY_CONTRACT.md), [`docs/MCP_AUDIT_CONTRACT.md`](docs/MCP_AUDIT_CONTRACT.md), and [`docs/RUNTIME_PROFILES.md`](docs/RUNTIME_PROFILES.md) to make the trust, schema, operator, procurement, and sizing story auditable from docs alone.
- `ingest-okta-system-log-ocsf` as the first external identity-vendor ingestion skill, mapping verified Okta System Log session, user lifecycle, and membership events into OCSF Authentication (3002), Account Change (3001), and User Access Management (3005).
- `detect-okta-mfa-fatigue` as the first Okta-native detection skill, emitting OCSF Detection Finding (2004) for repeated Okta Verify push challenge and denial bursts aligned to MITRE ATT&CK T1621.
- `ingest-entra-directory-audit-ocsf` as the Microsoft Entra / Graph identity-audit ingestion skill, mapping verified `directoryAudit` application, service-principal, app-role-assignment, and federated-credential events into OCSF API Activity (6003).
- `ingest-google-workspace-login-ocsf` as the Google Workspace identity-audit ingestion skill, mapping verified Admin SDK Reports login audit events into OCSF Authentication (3002) and Account Change (3001) while preserving Workspace natural IDs and event parameters.
- `detect-google-workspace-suspicious-login` as the first Google Workspace-native detection skill, emitting OCSF Detection Finding (2004) for provider-marked suspicious logins and repeated Workspace login failures followed by success, aligned to MITRE ATT&CK T1110 and T1078.
- `detect-entra-role-grant-escalation` as the narrow Entra follow-up detector for successful app-role assignments to service principals, aligned to MITRE ATT&CK `T1098.003` Additional Cloud Roles.
- a phased native/OCSF pilot for `ingest-cloudtrail-ocsf` and `detect-lateral-movement`, including explicit `--output-format {ocsf,native}` support, native/canonical-friendly test coverage, and MCP output-format selection for supported skills.
- repo-wide skill frontmatter for `approval_model`, `execution_modes`, and `side_effects`, plus CI enforcement and MCP tool-surface hints so human-in-the-loop expectations are explicit instead of inferred.
- optional `caller_roles`, `approver_roles`, and `min_approvers` contract metadata plus MCP caller-context propagation into write-capable skills, so remediation audit trails can record who invoked, who approved, and which request or session triggered the action.
- stderr-based MCP invocation audit events covering tool name, caller-context presence, approval-context presence, hashed arguments, duration, and exit status without logging raw stdin payloads.
- a shared opt-in `stderr` telemetry helper plus pilot JSON telemetry in `ingest-cloudtrail-ocsf` and `detect-lateral-movement`, enabled by `SKILL_LOG_FORMAT=json` or `AGENT_TELEMETRY=1` while preserving existing plain-text warnings by default.
- extended the structured `stderr` telemetry pilot to `ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf` and `detect-privilege-escalation-k8s`, so the Kubernetes ingest/detect path now has the same opt-in machine-readable runtime hints as the CloudTrail/lateral-movement path.
- extended the same opt-in structured `stderr` telemetry pilot to `ingest-okta-system-log-ocsf` and `detect-okta-mfa-fatigue`, covering the Okta identity ingest/detect path without changing stdout data contracts.
- extended the same opt-in structured `stderr` telemetry pilot to `ingest-google-workspace-login-ocsf` and `detect-google-workspace-suspicious-login`, covering the Google Workspace identity ingest/detect path without changing stdout data contracts.
- tightened the README and skill catalog entry path around use cases, skill selection, plug-in surfaces, and clearer layer guidance, plus added `docs/USE_CASES.md` as the practical crosswalk for sources, assets, frameworks, and starting skills.
- clarified in the README and use-case guide that repo-owned remediation audit lands in DynamoDB + S3 today, while generic sink skills now ship for Snowflake, ClickHouse, and S3; additional destinations such as Security Lake and BigQuery remain supported patterns rather than built-ins.
- a new start-here visual and updated IAM departures data-flow visual so operators can see sources, layer choice, outputs, runtime surfaces, and the shipped-vs-optional sink boundary without reading the full architecture docs first.
- a runtime-surfaces visual showing that CLI, CI, MCP, and persistent wrappers all call the same `SKILL.md + src/ + tests/` contract instead of creating parallel implementations.
- expanded the vendor icon asset set with Okta plus Microsoft Entra and Google Workspace stand-ins so the visual system can represent shipped identity sources alongside cloud and data-platform vendors.
- broadened the contract validator to fail on skill-like directories missing `SKILL.md`, and expanded the Bandit CI lane from a few hand-picked paths to `skills/`, `mcp-server/`, and `scripts/`.
- added a repo-aware `mypy` runner and CI lane that type-checks each skill `src/` directory in isolation plus `mcp-server/src/` and `scripts/`, so the repeated `ingest.py` / `detect.py` layout no longer blocks meaningful type enforcement.
- `scripts/validate_test_coverage.py` plus a dedicated CI coverage lane that now enforces real repo-level thresholds: `overall >= 70%`, `detection >= 80%`, and `evaluation >= 60%`.
- `runners/aws-s3-sqs-detect`, a repo-owned AWS reference runner template for `S3 -> ingest Lambda -> SQS -> detect Lambda -> DynamoDB dedupe -> SNS`, so persistent execution is no longer docs-only outside the IAM departures workflow.
- `runners/gcp-gcs-pubsub-detect` and `runners/azure-blob-eventgrid-detect` as the matching GCP and Azure reference runners, so the persistent execution story now has a shipped template on all three major clouds.
- `source-snowflake-query`, `source-databricks-query`, and `source-s3-select` as read-only source adapters for warehouse and object-store based pipelines.
- `sink-snowflake-jsonl`, `sink-clickhouse-jsonl`, and `sink-s3-jsonl` as write-capable persistence edges with dry-run-first contracts, explicit approval metadata, and auditable native result summaries.
- `packs/lateral-movement/` and `packs/privilege-escalation-k8s/` as the first shipped query-pack families proving warehouse-native detection can stay aligned with the Python skill intent.
- `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` plus explicit repo-level semver bump rules, and aligned local pre-commit Bandit scope with the same `skills/`, `mcp-server/`, and `scripts/` surface enforced in CI.
- `docs/CREDENTIAL_PROVENANCE.md` plus README / security-doc updates to make the repo's secret-minimizing credential posture explicit, document the remaining password/client-secret compatibility paths, and explain why direct Workday `httpx` access remains a narrow documented exception instead of a hidden supply-chain surprise.
- `docs/CANONICAL_SCHEMA.md` and `docs/DATA_FLOW.md` to pin the repo-owned canonical model and the raw → canonical → native / ocsf / bridge flow.
- `docs/SUPPLY_CHAIN.md` plus a new CI CycloneDX SBOM artifact, making the dependency-provenance, lockfile-ceiling, and runtime-surface story explicit for operators and auditors.
- a release workflow that attaches the signed CycloneDX SBOM artifact set directly to GitHub Releases instead of leaving it only as a CI artifact.

### Changed

- trimmed the handful of overlong `SKILL.md` frontmatter descriptions so tool-selection metadata stays concise for Claude, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cortex, and MCP clients.
- added optional `network_egress` skill metadata, exposed it through the MCP tool registry, and documented it in the skill/runtime contracts for sandbox-aware wrappers.
- added an explicit `## Do NOT do` anti-pattern section to `iam-departures-remediation` and surfaced network egress allowlist hints for the write-capable workflow.
- tightened the security and transparency language so dependency policy now explicitly prefers official vendor SDKs, treats `httpx` in the direct Workday API path as a documented exception, and points operators at the SBOM artifact instead of only the lockfile.
- Expanded the coverage registry and framework mapping docs to track Okta, Entra / Graph, and Google Workspace as first-class OCSF identity-ingestion sources and detections.
- Expanded `ingest-okta-system-log-ocsf` to cover the verified Okta Verify push and denial event families needed for narrow MFA fatigue detection.
- Reframed the repo contract so OCSF remains a first-class interoperability option, but not a mandatory storage or execution model; the stable internal contract is now explicitly source truth -> canonical model -> `native` / `ocsf` / `bridge` output.
- Made the OCSF metadata validator format-aware so native-mode support does not weaken the OCSF path contract.
- Extended the native/OCSF pilot to `ingest-vpc-flow-logs-ocsf`, so AWS flow logs can now emit either OCSF Network Activity or the repo's canonical native network-flow shape while preserving a compatible end-to-end lateral-movement path.
- Extended the native/OCSF pilot to `ingest-k8s-audit-ocsf` and `detect-sensitive-secret-read-k8s`, so Kubernetes audit ingestion and one Kubernetes detector now support the same dual-mode rollout pattern as the earlier CloudTrail / VPC / lateral-movement pilots.
- Extended the native/OCSF pilot to `detect-privilege-escalation-k8s`, so the main windowed Kubernetes privilege-escalation detector now accepts native or OCSF input and can emit native or OCSF findings.
- Extended the native/OCSF pilot to `ingest-mcp-proxy-ocsf` and `detect-mcp-tool-drift`, so the MCP application-activity ingestion and tool-drift detection path now supports native or OCSF input/output without changing the core drift logic.
- Extended the native/OCSF pilot to `ingest-google-workspace-login-ocsf` and `detect-google-workspace-suspicious-login`, so the Workspace login ingestion and suspicious-login detection path now supports native or OCSF input/output without changing the underlying detection semantics.
- Extended the native/OCSF pilot to `ingest-entra-directory-audit-ocsf` and `detect-entra-credential-addition`, so Entra directory-audit ingestion and credential-addition detection now support native or OCSF input/output without changing the underlying detection semantics.
- Extended the native/OCSF pilot to `ingest-okta-system-log-ocsf` and `detect-okta-mfa-fatigue`, so the Okta System Log ingestion and MFA-fatigue detection path now supports native or OCSF input/output without changing the underlying detection semantics.
- Finished the native/OCSF rollout across the shipped ingest and detect layers, so event and finding pipelines are now fully dual-mode wherever the repo intends interoperability parity.
- Made the README honest about current schema-mode rollout, required `input_formats` / `output_formats` for every shipped skill, and documented the native output fields on the currently dual-mode skills.
- Added a runnable README hello-world path, clarified that the `DATA_FLOW.md` rollout list is now driven by README + `SKILL.md` frontmatter, and documented bounded-batch guidance for `detect-lateral-movement`.
- Tightened the public contract so the repo is positioned as OCSF-default for streams and native-first for operational artifacts, with explicit lossy-mapping and schema-versioning policy instead of vague "optional OCSF" wording.
- Added `concurrency_safety` to every shipped skill plus validator enforcement for canonical frontmatter field order, making parallel-execution expectations explicit instead of tribal knowledge.
- Clarified the install and trust model in the README so the repo is presented as a tagged source release with pinned dependency groups and signed SBOMs, not as a generic opaque package install.

- `docs/COVERAGE_MODEL.md`, `docs/framework-coverage.json`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` to make framework, provider, asset, and execution coverage measurable and auditable.
- `scripts/validate_framework_coverage.py` so CI can reject undocumented or drifting coverage claims.
- explicit cross-cloud ATT&CK identity coverage metadata for `detect-lateral-movement`, covering AWS role pivots, GCP service-account pivots, and Azure role / managed-identity pivot anchors.
- explicit MITRE ATLAS and NIST AI RMF declarations for `gpu-cluster-security`, including machine-readable benchmark metadata for wrappers and coverage tests.
- `docs/RUNTIME_ISOLATION.md` to document sandboxing, credential scope, transport protections, integrity controls, and approval rules across CLI, CI, MCP, and persistent/serverless runs.
- Added deterministic `metadata.uid` to OCSF emitters and discovery bridge events for replay-safe SIEM dedupe.
- Added [`docs/SIEM_INDEX_GUIDE.md`](docs/SIEM_INDEX_GUIDE.md) covering index fields, timestamps, dedupe keys, and just-in-time vs persistent ingestion guidance.
- Added Azure Entra / Microsoft Graph credential-pivot coverage to `detect-lateral-movement`, including application and service-principal password-key changes, app-role grants, and federated identity credential creation.
- Added explicit NIST AI RMF traceability to `model-serving-security` and `discover-cloud-control-evidence`, including machine-readable benchmark metadata and an opt-in `ai-rmf` evidence mode.

### Changed
- Promoted the IAM departures cross-cloud workflow visual in `README.md` and made the CI badge explicitly track the `main` branch.
- Rebranded the public repo/docs surface to `cloud-ai-security-skills`, updated the MCP server name and project-scoped `.mcp.json`, and added a concise agent quick-start matrix for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and Cortex Code CLI.
- Normalized emitted OCSF and SARIF product/vendor identity to `cloud-ai-security-skills` while explicitly keeping older repo-local bridge/profile identifiers stable for compatibility.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Repo-wide `CHANGELOG.md` to make material architecture, security, and skill changes discoverable without reading every PR.
- [`docs/FRAMEWORK_MAPPINGS.md`](docs/FRAMEWORK_MAPPINGS.md) to consolidate ATT&CK, ATLAS, CIS, NIST, OWASP, SOC 2, ISO, and PCI coverage across the repo.
- First `discovery/` layer AI BOM skill, `discover-ai-bom`, which turns AI asset inventory snapshots into a deterministic CycloneDX-aligned BOM.
- First discovery-layer technical evidence skill, `discover-control-evidence`, which turns discovery artifacts into deterministic PCI / SOC 2 evidence JSON.
- `discover-cloud-control-evidence`, which turns AWS, GCP, and Azure inventory snapshots into deterministic PCI / SOC 2 technical evidence JSON.
- `discover-cloud-control-evidence --output-format ocsf-live-evidence`, which emits an OCSF Discovery / Live Evidence Info `[5040]` bridge event while preserving the native evidence document under `unmapped`.
- `discover-environment --output-format ocsf-cloud-resources-inventory`, which emits an OCSF Discovery / Cloud Resources Inventory Info `[5023]` bridge event while preserving the native environment graph under `unmapped`.
- deeper AI provider inventory and evidence coverage across AWS Bedrock / SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, Azure ML, and Azure AI Foundry in the discovery layer.
- deeper AI evaluation coverage in `model-serving-security`, including provider-shaped endpoint configs for SageMaker, Bedrock, Vertex AI, Azure ML, and Azure AI Foundry.

### Changed
- Removed the redirect-only `skills/ai-infra-security/` and `skills/compliance-cis-mitre/` stubs after the layered skill reshape settled.
- Reframed `skills/detection-engineering/` as a shared OCSF contract and golden-fixture namespace rather than a temporary transition root.
- Collapsed the largest CI matrices into grouped test lanes and added workflow concurrency so superseded PR runs cancel instead of flooding the queue.
- Added repo-level dependency/import consistency validation and aligned missing cloud SDK declarations in `pyproject.toml`.
- Moved `discover-environment` into the canonical `skills/discovery/` layer and wired discovery into the grouped `test-ai-infra` lane.
