# Debugging

Use this doc when a skill runs but the output is empty, malformed, or not in
the schema mode you expected.

## Fast checklist

1. Confirm the skill contract:
   - check `input_formats`
   - check `output_formats`
   - check `approval_model`
2. Confirm the invocation mode:
   - CLI
   - CI
   - MCP
   - persistent runner wrapper
3. Confirm the input shape:
   - `raw`
   - `native`
   - `canonical`
   - `ocsf`
4. Confirm you are reading `stdout` for structured results and `stderr` for
   warnings or partial-skip hints.

## Common failures

### `--output-format native` fails

Cause:
- the skill has not shipped dual-mode support yet

Check:
- the skill's `SKILL.md` `output_formats`
- the repo `README.md` schema-mode rollout section

Fix:
- use the default supported output mode for that skill
- or compose through a dual-mode upstream/downstream skill that already supports
  `native`

### Native output still looks like OCSF

Expected behavior:
- native output keeps the repo's canonical identity fields
- native output must not include the OCSF envelope fields such as:
  - `class_uid`
  - `category_uid`
  - `type_uid`
  - `metadata`

Check:
- `schema_mode` should be `native`
- `canonical_schema_version` should be present on current dual-mode skills

### Detector returns nothing

Most common causes:
- wrong input mode for that detector
- required upstream ingester was skipped
- timestamps fall outside the correlation window
- the source event family is out of scope for that rule

For windowed detectors, inspect:
- event ordering
- event timestamps
- provider and account alignment
- session identifiers

## Large-batch guidance

`detect-lateral-movement` currently materializes the normalized event stream for
the current run before correlation. That is fine for bounded batch windows, but
operators should not treat it as an infinite-stream daemon.

Recommended pattern today:
- partition by provider and account or tenant where possible
- process in bounded time windows
- keep each batch near the existing `15-minute` correlation window or another
  explicit operator-chosen chunk size
- for enterprise-scale replay, use a runner that chunks upstream data instead of
  pushing a full day of mixed audit and flow telemetry into one process

If you expect `100k+` events per day for one detection pass, document and apply
the chunking policy in the surrounding runner or job definition.

## MCP-specific debugging

If an MCP call fails before the skill runs:
- confirm the requested `output_format` is declared by the skill
- confirm write-capable skills include `--dry-run` where required
- confirm the MCP wrapper is exposing the latest skill metadata from `SKILL.md`

Relevant files:
- `mcp-server/src/server.py`
- `mcp-server/src/tool_registry.py`

## Cloud SDK import failures

Many cloud SDKs are imported lazily inside provider-specific functions.

If a skill loads but fails only when a provider branch executes:
- install the required dependency group
- confirm the provider SDK is declared in `pyproject.toml`
- confirm the target API response shape still matches the documented source

Use:
- `docs/SKILL_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/DEPENDENCY_HYGIENE_SKILL.md`
- the skill's `REFERENCES.md`

## When to suspect schema drift

Look for:
- new enum values
- renamed nested fields
- timestamp format changes
- missing natural IDs
- provider-side deprecations

Fix pattern:
- add a fixture for the new shape
- keep the old shape covered during migration
- update `REFERENCES.md`
- update the skill contract only in the same PR as the code change
